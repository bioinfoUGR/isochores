# Isochores predicted by IsoFinder in complete gap-free human genomes obtained by the T2T consortium

The genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates are made up of isochores, long DNA segments fairly homogeneous in G+C which were first revealed by analytical ultracentrifugation of bulk DNA [1]. The algorithm IsoFinder [2] is able to predict isochores at the sequence level. Most of the IsoFinder isochores show correlation with biological features such as gene density, SINE and LINE densities, recombination rate or SNP variability. The reliability of this algorithm in predicting isochore-like regions at the sequence level has been established through the analysis of large-scale genome patchiness by an independent method: the analysis of the deviations in the power-law behavior of long-range correlations [3,4].

Recently, the organization of isochores into high-level chromosome superstructures has been shown [5]. Every human chromosome seems composed of a few huge segments (~ 10 Mbp) of relatively homogeneous G+C content, which become the largest compositional organization of the genome.

On this website, you can find the coordinates of the isochores predicted by IsoFinder in complete gap-free human genome obtained by the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium [6]
